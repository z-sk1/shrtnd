# url-shortener


shrtnd is a url-shortener developed by me!! in go (backend) and html + js + css for the frontend


both the back and frontends have been deployed on Render, a free service which allows to deploy static sites and web services online, like AWS but for free cos i dont feel like paying for AWS, (or using it haha)


you can visit it on shrtnd.onrender.com and it will generate urls on the link: shrturl-u17c.onrender.com/random-code
